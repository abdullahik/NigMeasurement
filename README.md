# Nigeria Internet Measurement

The internet is a great tool that is helping to enhance human productivity while also providing an enabling environment for progress. Although the advantages of this technology are numerous, many populations especially in developing regions of the world are facing several challenges in harnessing this opportunity. Our research aims to understand the bottleneck in internet adoption and how internet connectivity is shaping the kind of application we build.  

To better understand the internet characteristics weâ€™ve built an android application that can help us in understanding the connectivity ecosystem of Nigeria. 

The app can be used for:
  1. internet speed measurement
  2. Ping Test and 
  3. Traceroute 
  
## [Please click to Download the App.](NigTool.apk) 
 
 After Installation, the app checks the internet speed and trace periodically
